# vote_weight_program


I wrote a program that changes the weight of each vote. Biden's votes are weighted slightly higher then Trumps making sure that even if Trump is ahead Biden will stay ahead regardless of votes.

It even takes the percentage that was changed based on weight and generates new vote totals matching the total votes originally cast for both candidates.

In other words this proves that you can cheat in an election by changing the reporting function of the voting machine code with either an update of the software or an injection script. Without inserting false ballots.
