# vote_weight_program


I wrote a program that changes the weight of each vote. Biden's votes are weighted slightly higher then Trumps making sure that even if Trump is ahead Biden will stay ahead regardless of votes.

It even takes the percentage that was changed based on weight and generates new vote totals matching the total votes originally cast for both candidates.

In other words this proves that you can cheat in an election by changing the reporting function of the voting machine code with either an update of the software or an injection script. Without inserting false ballots.


# DISCLAIMER: 

This is not source code from any voting machine or software that is used by any locality or precint. 

This is a basic program to prove the theory of the weighted voting method which also redistributes votes. 

Since most if not all elections software is closed source I am unsure of the correct programming language. So I chose Python.

This Program by no means supports Trump or Biden. It has no Bias, even though it shows this system being used against Trump it can be used against Biden as well.
